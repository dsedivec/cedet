;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   Speedbar provides a frame in which files, and locations in
;; files are displayed.  These functions provide Info specific support,
;; showing links and addresses in the side-bar.
;;
;;   To provide special service to all the modes supported by this file,
;; put the following in your .emacs file.
;;
;; (require 'speedbspec)
;;
;;   This will load in the known functions, and the mode-enabling code
;; into 'change-major-mode-hook.
;;
;;   This file requires speedbar.
