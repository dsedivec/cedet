;;; Commentary:
;;
;; The speedbar mode provides support for texinfo files by creating
;; tags using imenu.  This presentation do not reflect the natural
;; hierarchy of the texinfo document.
;;
;; This small add-on to speedbar provides an alternate way to
;; view the document which shows the natural hierarchy of the document.
;;
;; Installtation procedure:
;;   Not yet worked out.

;;; Change Log:
;;;
;;; 1.2 - Use newly created variable speedbar-texinfo-section-regexp rather
;;;       than texinfo-section-types-regexp, because the latter does not
;;;       have "top" in it.
;;;
;;;       Also added a hook to texinfo-mode-hook which sets
;;;       speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method to nil.
;;;
;;; 1.1 - first draft sent to Eric. on June 16, 2000.

;;; Code:

(require 'speedbar)

(add-to-list 'speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list
	     '(speedbar-fetch-dynamic-texinfo . speedbar-insert-texinfo-list))

(defun speedbar-texinfo-mode-hook ()
  (setq speedbar-tag-hierarchy-method nil))

(add-hook 'texinfo-mode-hook 'speedbar-texinfo-mode-hook)

(defconst speedbar-texinfo-section-regexp
  "^@\\(top \\|chapter \\|sect\\|subs\\|subh\\|unnum\\|major\\|chapheading \\|heading \\|appendix\\)")

;; This returns t if the major mode of the current buffer is not 'texinfo-mode.
;; If it is 'texinfo-mode, then this returns a list where each element is
;; (LEVEL NAME . MARKER).
;; LEVEL is 0, 1, 2, or 3 corresponding to chapter section,
;; subsection, and subsubsection respectively.
;; NAME is the name of the node.
;; MARKER is emacs marker that points to the beginning of the node.
;; The elements in the the list returned are in ascending order of the MARKER.
;; This function along with it's parter, speedbar-insert-texinfo-list, are
;; designed to be added to the speedbar-dynamic-tags-function-list list.
