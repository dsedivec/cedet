;;; Commentary:
;;;   Dialog mode requires the use of widget-d and widget-i.  It
;;; supplies mundane functions (basic drawing routines w/ faces) and
;;; also the framework in which the widgets work (The buffer, mode,
;;; keymap, etc).  Using `dialog-mode' lets you create a dialog in
;;; which you can place buttons and text fields within a top-level
;;; shell.  This mode manages the keymap, and the input is distributed
;;; to the correct active widget.
;;;
;;; To create a new dialog, you must follow these basic steps:
;;; 1) Create a new blank buffer
;;; 2) run `dialog-mode' on it
;;; 3) use `create-widget' to make widgets to make your dialog useful
;;;    (create-widget name class parent &rest resources)
;;;    - widget-label          - static text
;;;    - widget-button         - push it to make something happen
;;;    - widget-toggle-button  - push it to change a value
;;;    - widget-text-field     - a place to edit simple text
;;;    - widget-frame          - make a box around other widgets
;;;    Resources are :keys which specify how your widget behaves
;;; 4) call `dialog-refresh'
;;;
;;; Making widgets talk to eachother:
;;; Asside from `widget-core' there is also a `data-object' which
;;; provides a method for widgets to talk to eachother (ala
;;; fresco/interviews style)  A widget will create a data object if
;;; one is not given to it.  A widget always register's itself with
;;; the data object, and these objects alert viewers if they are
;;; changed.  In this way, a toggle button will automatically update
;;; itself if it's data has changed.
;;;
;;; For examples of how to make widgets interact, examine the function
;;; `dialog-test'
