;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Many types of code can be displayed as a series of connected
;; graphs, such as UML class or sequence diagrams.  COGRE attempts to
;; allow Emacs to display such graphs with data generated from
;; source code.
;;
;; COGRE is based on a generic editor that can handle arbitrary
;; graphs, with different specific graph types derived from that.
;; This depends on EIEIO for graph management.  COGRE depends on
;; `picture-mode' for drawing.  It also depends on semantic for
;; source-code parsing.
;;
;; Because COGRE graphs are meant to be edited in some fashion, COGRE
;; graphs depend on the custom widget library to provide text
;; controls, or toggle buttons for editing state in a graph.
