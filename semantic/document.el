;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Document provides the ability to create a documentation framework
;; for functions and variables.  It uses `semantic' to find the
;; current function, and to provide additional context information for
;; generating the documentation.
;;
;;   Document then provides some rules for creating English Text based
;; on the name of a given function, it's return type, or variable
;; type.  It also has output rules for texinfo, or comments.

;;; Code:
(defvar document-current-output-file nil
  "A marker for the current output file used for documentation.")


;;; User Functions
