;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library defines commands and a minor mode to navigate between
;; semantic language tokens in the current buffer.  It uses Eric Ludlam's
;; Semantic Bovinator tool to parse the buffer and find the language
;; tokens.

;; The commands `senator-next-token' and `senator-previous-token'
;; navigate respectively to the token after or before the point.  The
;; command `senator-jump' directly jumps to a particular semantic
;; symbol.

;; Also, for each built-in search command `search-forward',
;; `search-backward', `re-search-forward', `re-search-backward',
;; `word-search-forward' and `word-search-backward', there is an
;; equivalent `senator-<search-command>' defined which searches only
;; in semantic token names.

;; The command `senator-isearch-toggle-semantic-mode' toggles semantic
;; search in isearch mode.  When semantic search is enabled, isearch
;; is restricted to token names.

;; Finally, the library provides a `senator-minor-mode' to easily
;; enable or disable the SEmantic NAvigaTOR stuff for the current
;; buffer.

;; The best way to use navigation commands is to bind them to keyboard
;; shortcuts.  Senator minor mode uses the common prefix key "C-c ,".
;; The following default key bindings are provided when semantic minor
;; mode is enabled:
;;
;;    key             binding
;;    ---             -------
;;    C-c , n         `senator-next-token'
;;    C-c , p         `senator-previous-token'
;;    C-c , j         `senator-jump'
;;    C-c , i         `senator-isearch-toggle-semantic-mode'
;;    C-c , TAB       `senator-complete-symbol'
;;
;; To install, put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add
;;   (require 'senator)
;; into your ~/.emacs startup file.  To enable senator stuff in the
;; current buffer use
;;   (senator-minor-mode 1).

;; You can customize the `senator-step-at-token-ids' to navigate (and
;; search) only between tokens of a particular type.  (Such as
;; functions and variables.)

;; Customize `senator-step-at-start-end-token-ids' to stop at the
;; start and end of the specified token types.

;; To have a mode specific customization, do something like this in a hook:
;;
;; (add-hook 'mode-hook
;;           (lambda ()
;;             (setq senator-step-at-token-ids '(function variable))
;;             (setq senator-step-at-start-end-token-ids '(function))
;;             ))
;;
;; The above example specifies to navigate (and search) only between
;; functions and variables, and to step at start and end of functions
;; only.
;;
;; Any comments, suggestions, bug reports or upgrade requests are
;; welcome.  Please send them to David Ponce at <david@dponce.com>

;;; History:

;; $Log$
;; Revision 1.19  2001/02/01 19:38:53  zappo
;; `senator-complete-symbol' now checks that it complete the same symbol
;; to reuse `senator-last-completion-stat'.  This is needed when for
;; example completing "set..." and then completing "get..." at the same
;; point.
;;
;; Revision 1.18  2001/02/01 02:25:58  zappo
;; Removed compatibility code.
;; Added isearch code, which was in `senator-isearch'.  Made that shorter.
;; `senator-step-at-start-end-p' fixed up.
;; Use `semantic-nonterminal-children' instead of querying for type and
;; then getting the parts.
;; Use semantic's separator character.
;; Added senator-find-nonterminal- .. functions.  Uses semanticdb if loaded.
;; When completing, use `senator-find...'.
;; Also do a little more to track if we are doing the same completion.
;;
;; Revision 1.18  2001/01/31 00:54:06  zappo
;; senator-isearch was merged in.  Isearch fns are now much simpler.
;; Updated documentation.
;; Added xemacs `isearch-update-ring' compatibility function.
;; Use `semantic-nonterminal-children' instead of checking for 'type.
;; Fixed up `senator-complete-symbol'.
;;
;; Revision 1.16  2001/01/10 08:09:16  david_ponce
;; Fixed undeclared local variable 'slot' in `senator-menu-item'.
;;
;; Revision 1.15  2001/01/03 16:09:28  david_ponce
;; New version 2.1.
;;
;; Fixed a nasty typo in `senator-minor-mode'.  `run-hooks' were missing
;; a quotation before their arguments.  Thanks to "Charles Rich"
;; <rich@merl.com> who has reported this bug.
;;
;; Added new `senator-jump' command.  Thanks to "Eric M. Ludlam"
;; <zappo@ultranet.com> and "T. V. Raman" <tvraman@almaden.ibm.com> for
;; their help.
;;
;; Added new `senator-minor-mode-name' option to customize the name
;; displayed in the modeline when senator minor mode is on.
;;
;; When semantic isearch mode is on it now appends "/si" to the senator
;; minor mode name displayed in the modeline.
;;
;; Added new keyboard shortcut "\C-," to toggle semantic search in
;; isearch mode.
;;
;; Some code improvements.
;;
;; Revision 1.14  2000/12/12 11:02:16  david_ponce
;; `senator-mark-defun' now work on XEmacs too.
;;
;; Revision 1.13  2000/12/12 09:21:43  david_ponce
;; Fixed a "side effect" bug with latest `beginning-of-defun' and
;; `end-of-defun' advices.  They caused font-lock, which uses
;; beginning/end of defun to force a reparse.  Thanks to "Eric M. Ludlam"
;; <zappo@ultranet.com> for pointing this.
;;
;; Improved consistency with standard behaviour of `beginning-of-defun'
;; (go to the beginning of the line where the defun starts) and
;; `end-of-defun' (go to the beginning of the line following the end of
;; the defun).
;;
;; Added useful advices for `narrow-to-defun', `mark-defun' and
;; `c-mark-function'.
;;
;; Advices are enabled when the functions are called interactively and
;; `senator-minor-mode' is enabled.
;;
;; Revision 1.12  2000/12/11 14:05:06  david_ponce
;; Code cleanup and optimization.
;; `senator-next-token' and `senator-previous-token' now correctly work
;; when not binded to keyboard shortcuts.
;; `beginning-of-defun' and `end-of-defun' advices no more need to be
;; called interactively.  So `narrow-to-defun' can use these advices when
;; `senator-minor-mode' is enabled.
;;
;; Revision 1.11  2000/12/11 07:07:09  david_ponce
;; Applied Eric Ludlam's patch.  It adds a special face for senator to
;; use for momentary highlight (requires latest semantic-util.el).  If
;; the user cancels the parse (C-g) when `senator-minor-mode'
;; initializes, it doesn't kill the rest of the configuration.  (Useful
;; on a slow machine.)
;;
;; Revision 1.10  2000/12/08 16:18:32  david_ponce
;; A bunch of XEmacs compatibility code!
;;
;; Revision 1.9  2000/12/07 09:20:21  david_ponce
;; Applied Eric Ludlam's doc fix patch.
;;
;; Revision 1.8  2000/12/05 15:59:07  david_ponce
;; Improved consistency with built-in search commands.
;; New search commands like the ones in the Emacs Search menu.
;; Added a menu to senator minor mode.
;; The common prefix key in senator minor mode is now "C-c ,".
;; Updated header comments.
;; Some code cleanup.
;;
;; Revision 1.7  2000/12/05 11:13:19  david_ponce
;; New major version 2.0 with [i]search feature and a senator minor mode.
;; Added compatibility code between GNU Emacs 20.7 and 21.
;;
;; Revision 1.6  2000/11/28 12:44:47  david_ponce
;; More performance improvements.
;; New option `senator-highlight-found' to customize token highlighting.
;;
;; Revision 1.5  2000/11/27 13:24:17  david_ponce
;; Fixed a serious performance problem in `senator-next-token' and
;; `senator-previous-token'.
;;
;; Before searching for a next or previous token the point was just moved
;; to respectively the next or previous character. Thus, during
;; navigation, the buffer was explored character by character :-(.  Now
;; `senator-next-token' and `senator-previous-token' skip whole tokens
;; (unless they are 'type tokens which may include sub tokens).
;;
;; Revision 1.4  2000/11/14 17:23:21  david_ponce
;; Minor change to `senator-next-token' and `senator-previous-token' to
;; return the token at point.  Useful when calling these commands
;; non-interactively.
;;
;; Revision 1.3  2000/11/14 13:04:26  david_ponce
;; Improved navigation in semantic token where to step at start and end.
;;
;; - `senator-next-token' move the point to the end of token if it was at
;;   beginning or in the middle of the token.
;;
;; - `senator-previous-token' move the point to the beginning of token if
;;   it was at end or in the middle of the token.
;;
;; Revision 1.2  2000/11/10 17:11:15  david_ponce
;; Fixed a little bug in `senator-previous-token' navigation.
;;
;; Revision 1.1  2000/11/10 16:04:20  david_ponce
;; Initial revision.
