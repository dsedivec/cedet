;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library defines the commands `senator-next-token' and
;; `senator-previous-token' to navigate between language semantic
;; tokens in current buffer.  It uses Eric Ludlam's semantic bovinator
;; tool to parse the buffer and find the language tokens.
;;
;; To install, put this file on your Emacs-Lisp load path and add
;; (require 'senator) into your ~/.emacs startup file.

;; The best way to use these navigation commands is to bind them to
;; keyword shortcuts.  The following example respectively binds
;; `senator-next-token' and `senator-previous-token' to [A-next]
;; (Alt+PageDown) and [A-prior] (Alt+PageUp) keys for the given mode:
;;
;;  (define-key mode-map [A-next]  'senator-next-token)
;;  (define-key mode-map [A-prior] 'senator-previous-token)
;;
;; You can customize the `senator-step-at-token-ids' and
;; `senator-step-at-start-end-token-ids' options to navigate only
;; between particular tokens and to step at start and end of some of
;; them.  To have a mode specific customization, do something like
;; this in a hook:
;;
;; (add-hook 'mode-hook
;;           (lambda ()
;;             (setq senator-step-at-token-ids '(function variable))
;;             (setq senator-step-at-start-end-token-ids '(function))
;;             ))
;;
;; The above example specifies to navigate only between functions and
;; variables, and to step at start and end of functions only.
;;
;; Any comments, suggestions, bug reports or upgrade requests are
;; welcome.  Please send them to David Ponce at <david@dponce.com>

;;; Change Log:

;; $Log$
;; Revision 1.6  2000/11/28 12:44:47  david_ponce
;; More performance improvements.
;; New option `senator-highlight-found' to customize token highlighting.
;;
;; Revision 1.5  2000/11/27 13:24:17  david_ponce
;; Fixed a serious performance problem in `senator-next-token' and
;; `senator-previous-token'.
;;
;; Before searching for a next or previous token the point was just moved
;; to respectively the next or previous character. Thus, during
;; navigation, the buffer was explored character by character :-(.  Now
;; `senator-next-token' and `senator-previous-token' skip whole tokens
;; (unless they are 'type tokens which may include sub tokens).
;;
;; Revision 1.4  2000/11/14 17:23:21  david_ponce
;; Minor change to `senator-next-token' and `senator-previous-token' to
;; return the token at point.  Useful when calling these commands
;; non-interactively.
;;
;; Revision 1.3  2000/11/14 13:04:26  david_ponce
;; Improved navigation in semantic token where to step at start and end.
;;
;; - `senator-next-token' move the point to the end of token if it was at
;;   beginning or in the middle of the token.
;;
;; - `senator-previous-token' move the point to the beginning of token if
;;   it was at end or in the middle of the token.
;;
;; Revision 1.2  2000/11/10 17:11:15  david_ponce
;; Fixed a little bug in `senator-previous-token' navigation.
;;
;; Revision 1.1  2000/11/10 16:04:20  david_ponce
;; Initial revision.
