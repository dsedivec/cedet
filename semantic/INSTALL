How to install Semantic

1) Copy source files somewhere.

1.1) Optional: Install EIEIO CLOS library package from:
	http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml

2) Byte compile semantic (optional, but recommended)

   a) Edit Makefile, and change LOADPATH to include the path to EIEIO.
   b) run "make"

   -OR-

   a) run "make LOADPATH=<path to eieio>"

   If byte compilation fails fails:
    a) Follow step 3:
    b) byte compile the files individually and interactivly from
	Emacs or XEmacs.

3) Install load hooks into your .emacs file.

(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/semantic")
(setq semantic-load-turn-everything-on t)
(require 'semantic-load)


4) If turning everything on is too much:

   Remove the first line setting the variable that turns everything on.
   Investigate the file `semantic-load.el', and include those pieces
   you want to use.
