EDE is the Emacs Development Extensions.  EDE provides the gloss that
simplifies the learning curve for all the very useful functionality of
building and debugging under emacs.  In doing so it attempts to emulate
a typical IDE (Integrated Development Environment).  What this means is
that EDE will provide manage your makefiles and other building
environment duties so the developer can concentrate on code, and not
support files.  In doing so, it will be much easier for new programmers
to learn and adopt the GNU ways of doing things.
