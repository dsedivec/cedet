;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; EDE is the top level Lisp interface to a project management scheme
;; for Emacs.  Emacs does many things well, including editing,
;; building, and debugging.  Folks migrating from other IDEs don't
;; seem to thing this qualifies, however, because they still have to
;; write the makefiles, and specify parameters to programs.
;;
;; This EDE mode will attempt to link these diverse programs together
;; into a comprehensive single interface, instead of a bunch of
;; different ones.

;;; Install
;;
;;  Place these files in your load path, and byte compile them
;;
;;  ede and it's support files depend on:
;;   eieio and make-mode.  It will use compile, gud, and speedbar.
;;
;;  This command enables project mode on all files.
