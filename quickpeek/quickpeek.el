;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Quick peek is a tool designed to provide context information from a
;; source code buffer.  It does this through a floating frame.  By
;; default, it will show three lines of text, corresponding to any
;; relevant prototype, documantation, and completions.
;;
;; Quick peek can be independently configured on a per-language basis
;; to identify, and display useful information about the current
;; context.  When there is nothing useful to do, it does something
;; else.

;;; How to support quick peek in a Major mode.
;;
;; NOTE NOTE NOTE:
;;   This documents the current infrastruction.  A new infrastructure
;;   based on the semantic bovinator will be coming along next.
;;
;; Supporting quick peek in a major mode can be both easy, or complex
;; depending on the number of features you want to provide your users.
;;
;; At the simplest level, you need to set the variable
;; `quickpeek-info-function' to a function of your own devising.  This
;; is quickpeek's hook into your mode for display purposes.
;;
;; The return value of the `quickpeek-info-function' is a list.  The
;; first element of the list must be a quickpeek forms function.  You
;; can write your own form function (discussed later) or you can use
;; one of several built in functions.  The rest of the list elements
;; are parameters to the insert form.
;;
;; The most useful insert form is `quickpeek-functional-form', though
;; `quickpeek-simple-form' and `quickpeek-goofy-form' are also
;; useable.  Please see documentation on these functions for the
;; meaning of their parameters.  In many cases, the strings inserted
;; can follow the conventions of `quickpeek-plain-string-insert' which
;; permits addition of faces and (in the future) other formatting
;; features.  It will also strip most whitespace, so you must be careful.
;;
;; To write your own insert form, simply decide on the parameters,
;; and when it is called, assume that the current buffer is the
;; quickpeek frame.  You can then insert text, or add widgets.
;; Some good insert form helpers are: `quickpeek-insert-completions'
;; and `quickpeek-plain-string-insert'.
;;
;; Finding the info: Helper functions
;;
;; When writing a function to scan the buffers it is important to know
;; how the syntax tables work.  quickpeek depends on font-lock, and
;; its syntax table.  Font lock has gone through the trouble of
;; providing simplified searching syntax tables, specifically where
;; symbols such as _ become word constituants so you can search for
;; symbols with \\w.  By default, when your info function is called,
;; symbol constituants become word constituants through the font lock
;; maintained tables.
;;
;; If through some means you need to scan additional files, use the
;; function `quickpeek-with-alternate-syntax-table' to wrap your code
;; with this syntax table to simplify your regular expressions.
;;
;; In addition, if you want to use tags to find symbols for context
;; display, use the functions: `quickpeek-find-tag-stealthy' which
;; does not have any side effects, and returns a cons cell containing
;; the buffer and point of the symbol you want.
;;
;; Lastly, use `quickpeek-thing', and `quickpeek-thing-bounds' to
;; fetch a sexp under the point.  This simplifies getting the current
;; word for searching purposes.

;;; History:
;;
;; 0.5   Convert to using the dframe library for frame management.
;;
;; 0.4   Rename as quickpeek to avoid confusion with lazy-lock.
;;       Fixed CASE and constant colors.
;;
;; 0.3   Enable functions where return type and name are on different
;;         lines in the c language.
;;       Added `quickpeek-with-alternate-syntax-table', and use it.
;;       Made `thing-at-point' cover functions.
;;       Added `quickpeek-use-tags' flag variable.thing
;;       Added `quickpeek-tags-completion' as a local convenience.
;;       Added 'quickpeek-facep' macro as multi-platform convenience.
;;
;; 0.2   Improved the info gathering fn to report errors more effectivly.
;;       Improved lisp info gathering fn to exclude completion lists for
;;         very short symbols.
;;       Made the c info gatherer do something useful.  Added a
;;         non-desructive tag finder.
;;       Added some display types, including an error and simple type.
;;       Added a generic complex string inserttion function utility.
;;         This permits color use in the lazy frame.
;;       Now require's font lock.
;;       Fixed corrupt syntax table in main buffer.
;;
;; 0.1   First Release as lazy-look
